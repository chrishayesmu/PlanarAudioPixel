Client                   1.
Server                   2.

1. Client
----------

Connecting               1.1
Sending Check-Ins        1.2




1.1 Connecting
--------------

	To connect to the server, a client must construct and send a PacketStructures::NeworkMessage with the control byte set to ControlBytes::NEW_CONNECTION.


1.2 Sending Check-Ins
---------------------

	The client must construct and send a PacketStructures::NetworkMessage with the control byte set to ControlBytes::PERIODIC_CHECK_IN and the
	PacketStructures::NetworkMessage::ClientCheckIn filled in appropriately. It should do this WITHIN at least every CLIENT_CHECKIN_DELAY number
	of milliseconds.

	If the client fails to send a check in message within CLIENT_CHECKIN_DELAY milliseconds, it will be dropped and be refused further check ins.

	If the client is dropped, it will receive a network message with the ControlBytes::DISCONNECT control byte. If the client successfully receives
	this message, it can send a new connection message to reconnect.
